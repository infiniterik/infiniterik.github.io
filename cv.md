## Research Interests

My research interests combine ontology-driven semantic parsing and natural language processing techniques with generative AI to produce neurosymbolic representations for a variety of agent architectures powered by Large Language Models (LLM). Current work examines:

- The architectural foundation of LLM-powered agents with predictable personalities.
- Infusing LLM-powered agents with domain-specific knowledge.
- Using LLMs to validate the soundness and validity of arguments in human-like documents.
